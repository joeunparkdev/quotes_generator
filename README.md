# ðŸŒŸ Inspirational Quotes Generator Project ðŸŒŸ

This project is a simple web application that generates random inspirational quotes.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented using the following technologies:

- Ruby
- Go
- Sinatra (Ruby web framework)
- Puma (Ruby web server)
- Net::HTTP (HTTP client in Ruby)
- HTML/CSS (Frontend web development)
- Go HTTP package (HTTP server in Go)

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to generate random inspirational quotes and display them on a web page. We mixed Ruby and Go to write server-side logic and used Sinatra and Go's HTTP package to build the web server.

## How to Run

1. First, clone this repository.
2. Execute the code for each language:
    - To run the Ruby application, execute the command `ruby app.rb`.
    - To run the Go application, execute the command `go run main.go`.
3. Open `http://localhost:4567` in your web browser.

## References

In this project, we use an external API for inspirational quotes generation. For this purpose, each server in both languages sends an HTTP request to the respective API, processes the response, and displays it on the web page.
